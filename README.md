# mtxTextUI [FREE][STANDALONE]

Hello! I created this **FiveM script** a few years ago and have decided to publish it since it no longer serves a purpose for me. While the code isnâ€™t my best work, Iâ€™ve made it available for free.

## Features
* Lightweight
* 0.00ms idle time (0.01ms during activity)
* Close with a key
* Easy-to-understand code
* Standalone
* Simple to use with pre-made colors, exports, and trigger events
* Supports HTML with pre-written styles
* Includes features for tables, lists, progress, etc.
* Discord logs via webhooks
